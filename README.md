opensource projects :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:) 

Drop in at [Issues](https://github.com/tifac/school-mgmt/issues) to see the current discussions. Any doubts or
bugs or any recommendations can be posted here. Create an issue if you want to start a discussion :smile:

Let's make use of [Wiki](https://github.com/tifac/school-mgmt/wiki) and [Issues](https://github.com/tifac/school-mgmt/issues)
extensively and make that goddamned WhatsApp group obsolete :satisfied:
